      calculate the maximum tags at the exact same location
      based on binomal distribution using 1e-5 as pvalue
      cutoff; and the 'all' option keeps every tags. If an
      integer is given, at most this number of tags will be

      BUFFER_SIZE
      Buffer size for incrementally increasing internal

      most cases, you don't have to change this parameter.
      However, if there are large number of
      chromosomes/contigs/scaffolds in your alignment, it's
      recommended to specify a smaller buffer size in order
      to decrease memory usage (but it will take longer time
      to read alignment files). Minimum memory requested for
      reading an alignment file is about # of CHROMOSOME *
